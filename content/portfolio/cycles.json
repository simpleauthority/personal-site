    "description": "Note: There are some issues with the time intervals at present. The cycles app allows you to choose whether or not you are going to sleep now or if you have a specific time you'd like to wake up. Once you've made your choice, it calculates a few optimal times at which you should be asleep in order to maximize your sleep cycles and thereby your sleep efficiency.",
